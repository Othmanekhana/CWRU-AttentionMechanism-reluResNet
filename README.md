# CWRU-AttentionMechanism-ResNet
This libary includes the source code, data set and results of the paper "Temporal attention mechanism for bearing fault diagnosis in nuclear power plant rotating machines".
The classification and recognition task in the paper is called case1 in the code.

1. Run Tresnet_case1.py to solve the recognition task through Traditional Resnet.
2. Run Aresnet_case1.py to solve the recognition task through Attention Augmented Resnet.
3. The running result is saved in the Result folder.
3. Run Computeconf.m (matlab code) to further process the result to obtain confusion matrixs.
